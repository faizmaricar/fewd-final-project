Born and raised in the ethnic maelstrom of 19th-century New Orleans, George Herriman, the creator of the seminal comic strip <i>Krazy Kat</i> came of age as an illustrator, journalist, and cartoon artist in the boom town of Los Angeles and the wild metropolis of New York. Rocketing to early fame in the newspapers of the early 20th century, Herriman's work was both hugely popular and widely acknowledged as the cartoon that elevated cartoons from daily diversions to an anarchic art form. Yet underlying his whole life - and often sneaking into the contours of his very public art - was a very private fact: known as \"the Greek\" for his swarthy complexion and curly hair, Herriman was in fact an African-American. Drawing on deep original research into Herriman's family historY and on a deep reading of the artist's work and surviving written records, Michael Tisserand restores this little-understood figure to vivid life.",

Instead, he lives in a constant dream-state where sometimes it's hard to decipher what's real and what isn't.<br/> A side effect of his supernatural insomnia allows him to see patterns and make connections no one else can. This ability serves Flood well in his new \"career\" as a makeshift private investigator, and he's recruited an ex-cop looking for redemption to be his assistant.<br/> When the pair begins to unravel the connection between thousands of unsolved and seemingly unrelated murders, Flood discovers the one secret that has eluded him: his own past.<br/> Collects the complete limited series. <br/> \"...an entertaining and exciting comic book full of engaging characters, solid plot structure and knockout art and design...\" - Comic Book Resources",
