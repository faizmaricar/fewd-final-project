It covers not only the action of the event but the details of deployment and build-up that led to the deadly encounter for these young American G.I.s.<br/> For decades, Joe Kubert has shown readers the true face of war - all the suffering, horror, loss and heroism of our fighting forces. With DONG XAOI, he goes a step beyond to tell a gut-wrenching tale of sacrifice that will linger long after you are done reading.<br/>"

In the shadows of the War, the roots of the Golden Tree cabal grew deep into the heart of a fallen world... and the leaders at the heart of this secret organization see no place in their utopia for heroism. Doc Savage, struggling with the loss of his father, has been blind to their advance - until now. Central City's mysterious Spirit has caught wind of their plans as well. But whose side have the Blackhawks chosen? What is the Red Right Hand? And where is the Batman? Eisner Award winner Brian Azzarello (100 BULLETS, JOKER) and superstar Rags Morales (IDENTITY CRISIS) craft a DC universe like you've never seen before! It's a world with no supermen, only mortal men... Death can come at any moment, and adventure can still be found at every corner of the map! Will Doc Savage be the first to lead the coming world or the last to be crushed under its heel?<br/> Retailers please note: This issue will ship with two covers.
